# SPACE SCENE SANDBOX

## Introduction

This is a small demo scene built with the help of Three.js, React, React-Three-Fiber, and a couple of libraries from my own Open Source project, [The Composer Suite](https://github.com/hmans/composer-suite), a collection of libraries for building games in the browser.

Notably, the asteroid rings and the "space fog" around the planet are built with the help of Shader Composer (build shaders with JavaScript), Material Composer (create Three.js materials from shader modules), and VFX Composer (a high-performance particles system engine that uses the other two libraries under the hood.)

## Running the demo

The running demo can be seen here in all its glory:
